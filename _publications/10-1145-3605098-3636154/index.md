abstract: Cyber ranges are virtual training ranges that have emerged as indispensable
  environments for conducting secure exercises and simulating real or hypothetical
  scenarios. These complex computational infrastructures enable the simulation of
  attacks, facilitating the evaluation of defense tools and methodologies and developing
  novel countermeasures against threats. One of the main challenges of cyber range
  scalability is the exercise evaluation that often requires the manual intervention
  of human operators, the White team. This paper proposes a novel approach that uses
  Blue and Red team reports and well-known databases to automate the evaluation and
  assessment of the exercise outcomes, overcoming the limitations of existing assessment
  models. Our proposal encompasses evaluating various aspects and metrics, explicitly
  emphasizing Blue Teams' actions and strategies and allowing the automated generation
  of their cyber posture.
