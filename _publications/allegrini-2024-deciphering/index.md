abstract: Social media platforms continue to struggle with the growing presence of
  social bots-automated accounts that can influence public opinion and facilitate
  the spread of disinformation. Over time, these social bots have advanced significantly,
  making them increasingly difficult to distinguish from genuine users. Recently,
  new groups of bots have emerged, utilizing Large Language Models to generate content
  for posting, further complicating detection efforts. This paper proposes a novel
  approach that uses algorithms to measure the similarity between DNA strings, commonly
  used in biological contexts, to classify social users as bots or not. Our approach
  begins by clustering social media users into distinct macro species based on the
  similarities (and differences) observed in their timelines. These macro species
  are subsequently classified as either bots or genuine users, using a novel metric
  we developed that evaluates their behavioral characteristics in a way that mirrors
  biological comparison methods. This study extends beyond past approaches that focus
  solely on identical behaviors via analyses of the accounts' timelines. By incorporating
  new metrics, our approach systematically classifies non-trivial accounts into appropriate
  categories, effectively peeling back layers to reveal non-obvious species.
