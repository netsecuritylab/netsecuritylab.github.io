abstract: 'Online Social Networks have revolutionized how we consume and share information,
  but they have also led to a proliferation of content not always reliable and accurate.
  One particular type of social accounts is known to promote unreputable content,
  hyperpartisan, and propagandistic information. They are automated accounts, commonly
  called bots. Focusing on Twitter accounts, we propose a novel approach to bot detection:
  we first propose a new algorithm that transforms the sequence of actions that an
  account performs into an image; then, we leverage the strength of Convolutional
  Neural Networks to proceed with image classification. We compare our performances
  with state-of-the-art results for bot detection on genuine accounts/bot accounts
  datasets well known in the literature. The results confirm the effectiveness of
  the proposal, because the detection capability is on par with the state of the art,
  if not better in some cases.'
