abstract: In the rapidly changing landscape of online social interactions, the presence
  of automated accounts, or bots, has always posed a significant challenge to maintaining
  platforms where the information posted is authentic and reliable. The emergence
  of large language models (LLMs) may exacerbate this problem, as researchers have
  recently found families of automated accounts that use generative artificial intelligence
  to produce their posts. This paper focuses on this new type of bot, particularly
  on detecting them. Using a new detection technique that relies on image classification
  to distinguish between human and automated accounts, we demonstrate remarkable efficiency
  in identifying bots whose posts are generated by large language models. Our research
  improves the results of previous work on the detection of bot accounts powered by
  generative artificial intelligence.
