abstract: Since the origins of the Internet, various vulnerabilities exploiting the
  IP fragmentation process have plagued IPv4 protocol, many leading to a wide range
  of attacks. IPv6 modified the handling of fragmentations and introduced a specific
  extension header, not solving the related problems, as proved by extensive literature.
  One of the primary sources of problems has been the overlapping fragments, which
  result in unexpected or malicious packets when reassembled. To overcome the problem
  related to fragmentation, the authors of RFC 5722 decided that IPv6 hosts MUST silently
  drop overlapping fragments.
