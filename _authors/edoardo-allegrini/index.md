Hi, I'm Edoardo Allegrini. I’m a master’s student in Cybersecurity at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it). These years as a graduate student are enriched by a research scholarship from the Computer Science Department where I am a member of the Network Security Lab.

I am interested in tackling complex problems, particularly at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI. At the moment, I am researching Social Bots, developing detection techniques to combat online manipulation. Additionally, I am working on AI-enhanced methods for Binary Analysis to improve vulnerability detection and malware analysis.
