Hi, I'm Edoardo Allegrini. I’m a master’s student in Cybersecurity at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it). These years as a graduate students are enriched by a research scholarship from the Computer Science Department where I am a member of the Network Security Lab.

I am interested in tackling complex problems, particularly at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI. At the moment, I am working on designing, developing, and testing an innovative approach to accurately detect and identify bot activity on social media platforms.
