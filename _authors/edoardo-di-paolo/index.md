Hi, I am Edoardo Di Paolo, a second year Ph.D. student in Cybersecurity at <a href="https://www.uniroma1.it/it/" target="_blank">La Sapienza</a> in Rome and I am a member of the Network Security Lab.

My interests in Computer Science include different fields such as IoT, artificial intelligence, anomalies on Social Networks and networks security. Currently, I am doing a research on social bots and IPv6 security.
