<h2>Welcome to the NetSecurity Lab</h2>


The **Network Security Lab** is a research group at the **Department of Computer Science** at Sapienza University of Rome. Under the supervision of **Professor Angelo Spognardi**, our lab investigates a wide range of topics at the intersection of cybersecurity, anomaly detection, and artificial intelligence.

Our research focuses on **anomaly detection in social networks**, using both **AI-based** and traditional models, as well as the **security of IPv6 networks**. We also study innovative methods for **password generation** through Large Language Models (**LLMs**), classification of **encrypted internet traffic**, and the security challenges related to the Internet of Things (**IoT**).

The memebers of our group come from a diverse range of backgrounds, including cybersecurity, computer science, and computer engineering. This interdisciplinary approach enriches our research, allowing us to tackle complex problems from multiple perspectives.

At the Network Security Lab, our mission is to push boundaries of knowledge in network security and contribute to the undestaing and development of secure internet.
